# ctgan_tabular_data

This repo is to validate if we can use CTGAN to generate tabular data and improve imbalanced dataset

To follow along, please check the Medium article: [Can we handle an Imbalanced dataset by generating Synthetic data with Conditional Tabular GAN? | CreditÂ data](https://towardsdatascience.com/24x5-stock-trading-agent-to-predict-stock-prices-with-deep-learning-with-deployment-c15570720ae9).


## Analysis


1. Get Kaggle credit card dataset
2. Use SMOTE andg generate synthetic data 
3. Use CTGAN and generate data
4. Create model and compare results
